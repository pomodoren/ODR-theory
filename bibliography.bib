The problem may stem in part from methodologies that are insensitive to potential subgroups within the at-risk, preclinical AD population (PCAD). The present study investigated the utility of asymmetric cognitive profiles in identifying individuals at risk for AD. Twenty elderly adults who were later diagnosed with AD (PCAD) and 20 matched control participants were compared on measures of cognitive asymmetry derived from difference scores on tests of verbal and visuospatial ability. Although both groups performed similarly on the individual tests, comparisons using difference scores revealed significantly larger discrepancies between naming and visuoconstruction skills in the PCAD group. The PCAD group also had a higher frequency of asymmetric cognitive profiles relative to a normative group.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The growing propensity to diagnose AD in individuals with very mild cognitive impairment increases the danger of false-positive diagnostic errors. Unfortunately, there is little systematically acquired information about the accuracy of the AD diagnosis in very mildly impaired patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of the diagnosis of AD in very mildly impaired patients and to identify objective measures that effectively distinguish these patients from elderly normal controls (NC). METHODS: Consecutive patients with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of > or = 24 who received a clinical diagnosis of AD were evaluated annually for at least 3 years. The initial diagnosis was verified or refuted by autopsy or by information obtained in subsequent evaluations. Initial neuropsychological test scores of verified AD patients were compared with those of NC subjects to identify effective diagnostic measures. RESULTS: The diagnosis of AD was confirmed in 98 of 110 (89\%) very mildly impaired patients (33/36 by autopsy, 65/74 by disease progression). The diagnosis was inaccurate in 12 patients (11\%): Seven were subsequently diagnosed with other neurologic disorders, and five were ultimately found to be normal. Neuropsychological measures of delayed recall, verbal fluency, and global cognitive status (i.e., Mattis Dementia Rating Scale) provided excellent sensitivity (> or = 96\%) and specificity (> or = 93\%) for differentiating between very mildly impaired AD patients and NC subjects. CONCLUSIONS: When comprehensive assessment procedures are employed, AD can be diagnosed with reasonably high accuracy in very mildly impaired individuals. However, the dementia evaluation should be repeated after approximately 1 year to ensure the accuracy of the initial diagnosis.}

Quantitative and qualitative differences are apparent across many cognitive domains, but are especially obvious in episodic memory (particularly delayed recall), semantic knowledge, and some aspects of executive functions. The qualitatively distinct pattern of deficits is less salient in very old AD patients than in younger AD patients. Although decline in episodic memory is usually the earliest cognitive change that occurs prior to the development of the AD dementia syndrome, asymmetry in cognitive abilities may also occur in this ``preclinical'' phase of the disease and predict imminent dementia. Discrete patterns of cognitive deficits occur in AD and several neuropathologically distinct age-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Knowledge of these differences helps to clinically distinguish among various causes of dementia and provides useful models for understanding brain-behavior relationships that mediate cognitive abilities affected in various neurodegenerative diseases.}

However, to our knowledge, the utility of those interpretive guidelines has not been cross-validated or applied to a heterogeneous sample of dementia cases. Objective: To cross-validate the staging guidelines proposed in a previous study using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database. Design: The previously published cut scores were applied to the NACC sample and diagnostic accuracy estimates obtained. Next, analyses were restricted to NACC participants with a CDR global score (CDR-GS) of 0.5 and receiver operating characteristic curves generated to determine optimal CDR-SB cut scores for distinguishing MCI from very early dementia. Setting: The 2008 NACC uniform data set. Participants: There were 12 462 participants (5115 controls; 2551 patients with MCI; 4796 patients with dementia, all etiologies) in the NACC data set used for the current analysis. Main Outcome Measure: Accurate prediction of diagnoses (MCI or dementia) using the CDR-SB score. Results: The previously proposed CDR-SB ranges successfully classified the vast majority of patients across all impairment ranges with a $\kappa$ of 0.91 and 94% overall correct classification rate. Additionally, the CDR-SB score discriminated between patients diagnosed with MCI and dementia when CDR-GS was restricted to 0.5 (overall area under the curve=0.83). Conclusions: These findings cross-validate the previously published CDR-SB interpretative guidelines for staging dementia severity and extend those findings to a large heterogeneous sample of patients with dementia. Additionally, the CDR-SB scores distinguished MCI from dementia in patients with reasonable accuracy when CDR-GS was restricted to 0.5. {\textcopyright}2010 American Medical Association.

  abstract = {Based on the recent literature and collective experience, an international consortium developed revised guidelines for the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. The validation process retrospectively reviewed clinical records and compared the sensitivity of proposed and earlier criteria in a multi-site sample of patients with pathologically verified frontotemporal lobar degeneration. According to the revised criteria, 'possible' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia requires three of six clinically discriminating features (disinhibition, apathy/inertia, loss of sympathy/empathy, perseverative/compulsive behaviours, hyperorality and dysexecutive neuropsychological profile). 'Probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia adds functional disability and characteristic neuroimaging, while behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia 'with definite frontotemporal lobar degeneration' requires histopathological confirmation or a pathogenic mutation. Sixteen brain banks contributed cases meeting histopathological criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration and a clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or vascular dementia at presentation. Cases with predominant primary progressive aphasia or extra-pyramidal syndromes were excluded. In these autopsy-confirmed cases, an experienced neurologist or psychiatrist ascertained clinical features necessary for making a diagnosis according to previous and proposed criteria at presentation. Of 137 cases where features were available for both proposed and previously established criteria, 118 (86) met 'possible' criteria, and 104 (76) met criteria for 'probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In contrast, 72 cases (53) met previously established criteria for the syndrome (P<0.001 for comparison with 'possible' and 'probable' criteria). Patients who failed to meet revised criteria were significantly older and most had atypical presentations with marked memory impairment. In conclusion, the revised criteria for behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia improve diagnostic accuracy compared with previously established criteria in a sample with known frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Greater sensitivity of the proposed criteria may reflect the optimized diagnostic features, less restrictive exclusion features and a flexible structure that accommodates different initial clinical presentations. Future studies will be needed to establish the reliability and specificity of these revised diagnostic guidelines. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.},

  abstract = {Cognitive reserve (CR) modulates the relationship between clinical and pathological phenotypes by restricting the negative effect of cerebral lesions on cognition, according to the CR hypothesis. In this study, we evaluated 18 healthy subjects and 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using conventional MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MMSE, WMS and MoCA assessments were repeated 1 year later. The MRS analysis results showed that the N-acetyl-aspartate peak area (NAA; t = 5.122, P < 0.001) and the NAA/creatine (Cr), NAA/myo-inositol (mI) and NAA/choline (Cho) ratios were significantly changed in patients with MCI compared with the control subjects (all P < 0.01). The MoCA was significantly related to the NAA/Cho ratio (R = 0.443), the NAA/Cr ratio (R = 0.533), and the NAA peak area (R = 0.814; all P < 0.05), but was unrelated to the NAA/mI ratio (R = 0.400, P = 0.072). We found that the hippocampal volume was significantly correlated with the MoCA, WMS and MMSE (R = 0.704, 0.677, 0.542 respectively; all P < 0.05). Education level had a positive effect on changes in the MoCA, MMSE, and WMS 1 year later. We believe that MoCA and WMS results, MRI hippocampal volume and other related indicators (NAA peak area, NAA/Cr ratio, NAA/mI ratio, and NAA/Cho ratio) may reflect the degree of CR capacity, and that the number of years of education can significantly affect the changes in cognitive function in patients with MCI. Therefore, increasing levels of education and life skills training can help increase CR, reduce the risk of MCI, and slow down the appearance of clinical manifestations and clinical progress in patients with MCI. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {With the aging of the baby boomers and medical advances that promote longevity, older adults are rapidly becoming the fastest growing segment of the population. As the population ages, so does the incidence of age related disorders. Many predict that 15% - 20% of the baby-boomer generation will develop some form of cognitive decline over the course of their lifetime, with estimates escalating to up to 50% in those achieving advanced age. Although much attention has been directed at Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, it is estimated that nearly one third of those cases of cognitive decline result from other neuropathological mechanisms. In fact, many patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease likely have co-morbid disorders that can also influence cognition (i.e., vascular cognitive impairment), suggesting mixed dementias are grossly under diagnosed. The Clinical Handbook on the Neuropsychology of Aging and Dementia is a unique work that provides clinicians with expert guidance and a hands-on approach to neuropsychological practice with older adults. The book will be divided into two sections, the first addressing special considerations for the evaluation of older adults, and the second half focusing on common referral questions likely to be encountered when working with this age group. The authors of the chapters are experts and are recognized by their peers as opinion leaders in their chosen chapter topics. The field of neuropsychology has played a critical role in developing methods for early identification of late life cognitive disorders as well as the differential diagnosis of dementia. Neuropsychological assessment provides valuable clinical information regarding the nature and severity of cognitive symptoms associated with dementia. Each chapter will reinforce the notion that neuropsychological measures provide the clinician with sensitive tools to differentiate normal age-related cognitive decline from disease-associated impairment, aid in differential diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction in older adults, as well as identify cognitive deficits most likely to translate into functional impairments in everyday life.},

  abstract  = {In order to determine the frequency of microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) mutations and rare variants in CBD, we performed a systematic sequence analysis of MAPT coding and 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in a large cohort of autopsy-confirmed CBD patients (N = 109). This identified a novel MAPT mutation in exon 13, p.N410H, in a case that is neuropathologically indistinguishable from sporadic CBD. On immunoblot, the p.N410H mutation carrier had the same insoluble tau profile as seen in CBD. Additionally, tau expression analysis in brain tissue found a significant increase in the 4R/3R tau mRNA ratio (P = 0.04), indicating that p.N410H disrupts tau isoform homeostasis. Biochemically, recombinant tau protein with p.N410H showed a marked increase in tau filament formation compared to wild-type tau (P < 0.001), had a 19.2\% decrease in rate of microtubule assembly (P < 0.05), and a 10.3\% reduction in the extent of total microtubule polymerization (P < 0.01). Sequence analysis of the complete MAPT 3′UTR in autopsy-confirmed CBD cases further identified two rare variants with nominally significant association with CBD. An ATC nucleotide insertion (``MAPTv8'') was found in 4.6\% of CBD patients compared to 1.2\% of controls (P = 0.031, OR = 3.71), and rs186977284 in 4.6\% CBD patients, but only 0.9\% of controls (P = 0.04, OR = 3.58). Rs186977284 was also present in 2.7\% of a large cohort of autopsy-confirmed PSP patients (N = 566) and only 0.9\% of an additional control series (P = 0.034, OR = 3.08), extending the association to PSP. Our findings show that mutations in MAPT can cause CBD and MAPT non-coding variants may increase the risk of complex 4R tauopathies.}

This Position Paper considers the strengths and limitations of the IWG research diagnostic criteria and proposes advances to improve the diagnostic framework. On the basis of these refinements, the diagnosis of AD can be simplified, requiring the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype (typical or atypical) and a pathophysiological biomarker consistent with the presence of Alzheimer's pathology. We propose that downstream topographical biomarkers of the disease, such as volumetric MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, might better serve in the measurement and monitoring of the course of disease. This paper also elaborates on the specific diagnostic criteria for atypical forms of AD, for mixed AD, and for the preclinical states of AD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Cognitive reserve describes the mismatch between brain integrity and cognitive performance. Older adults with high cognitive reserve are more resilient to age-related brain pathology. Traditionally, cognitive reserve is indexed indirectly via static proxy variables (e.g., years of education). More recently, cross-sectional studies have suggested that reserve can be expressed as residual variance in episodic memory performance that remains after accounting for demographic factors and brain pathology (whole brain, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes). The present study extends these methods to a longitudinal framework in a community-based cohort of 244 older adults who underwent two comprehensive neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging sessions over 4.6 years. On average, residual memory variance decreased over time, consistent with the idea that cognitive reserve is depleted over time. Individual differences in change in residual memory variance predicted incident dementia, independent of baseline residual memory variance. Multiple-group latent difference score models revealed tighter coupling between brain and language changes among individuals with decreasing residual memory variance. These results suggest that changes in residual memory variance may capture a dynamic aspect of cognitive reserve and could be a useful way to summarize individual cognitive responses to brain changes. Change in residual memory variance among initially non-demented older adults was a better predictor of incident dementia than residual memory variance measured at one time-point.},

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the main findings in AD and normal aging over the past twenty years, focusing on the patterns of gray and white matter changes assessed in vivo using MRI. Major progresses in the field concern the segmentation of the hippocampus with novel manual and automatic segmentation approaches, which might soon enable to assess also hippocampal subfields. Advancements in quantification of hippocampal volumetry might pave the way to its broader use as outcome marker in AD clinical trials. Patterns of cortical atrophy have been shown to accurately track disease progression and seem promising in distinguishing among AD subtypes. Disease progression has also been associated with changes in white matter tracts. Recent studies have investigated two areas often overlooked in AD, such as the striatum and basal forebrain, reporting significant atrophy, although the impact of these changes on cognition is still unclear. Future integration of different MRI modalities may further advance the field by providing more powerful biomarkers of disease onset and progression.},

While the association between these biomarkers and eventual AD has been demonstrated among cognitively intact older adults, the link between biomarkers and neurocognitive ability remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that cognitively intact older adults would show statistically discernable differences in neuropsychological performance by amyloid status (amyloid negative = A-, amyloid positive = A+). We secondarily hypothesized a third group characterized by either CSF tau pathology or neurodegeneration, in addition to amyloidosis (A+/N+ or Stage 2), would show lower neuropsychology scores than the amyloid positive group (A+/N- or Stage 1) when compared to the amyloid negative group. Pubmed, PsychINFO, and other sources were searched for relevant articles, yielding 775 total sources. After review for inclusion/exclusion criteria, duplicates, and risk of bias, 61 studies were utilized in the final meta-analysis. Results showed A+ was associated with poorer performance in the domains of global cognitive function, memory, language, visuospatial ability, processing speed, and attention/working memory/executive functions when compared to A-. A+/N+ showed lower performances on memory measures when compared to A+/N- in secondary analyses based on a smaller subset of studies. Results support the notion that neuropsychological measures are sensitive to different stages of preclinical AD among cognitively intact older adults. Further research is needed to determine what constitutes meaningful differences in neuropsychological performance among cognitively intact older adults.},

The revised DLB consensus criteria now distinguish clearly between clinical features and diagnostic biomarkers, and give guidance about optimal methods to establish and interpret these. Substantial new information has been incorporated about previously reported aspects of DLB, with increased diagnostic weighting given to REM sleep behavior disorder and 123 iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy. The diagnostic role of other neuroimaging, electrophysiologic, and laboratory investigations is also described. Minor modifications to pathologic methods and criteria are recommended to take account of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, to add previously omitted Lewy-related pathology categories, and to include assessments for substantia nigra neuronal loss. Recommendations about clinical management are largely based upon expert opinion since randomized controlled trials in DLB are few. Substantial progress has been made since the previous report in the detection and recognition of DLB as a common and important clinical disorder. During that period it has been incorporated into DSM-5, as major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. There remains a pressing need to understand the underlying neurobiology and pathophysiology of DLB, to develop and deliver clinical trials with both symptomatic and disease-modifying agents, and to help patients and carers worldwide to inform themselves about the disease, its prognosis, best available treatments, ongoing research, and how to get adequate support.}

  abstract = {Background: The number of individuals living with dementia is increasing, negatively affecting families, communities, and health-care systems around the world. A successful response to these challenges requires an accurate understanding of the dementia disease burden. We aimed to present the first detailed analysis of the global prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of dementia as captured by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2016, and highlight the most important messages for clinicians and neurologists. Methods: GBD 2016 obtained data on dementia from vital registration systems, published scientific literature and surveys, and data from health-service encounters on deaths, excess mortality, prevalence, and incidence from 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, through systematic review and additional data-seeking efforts. To correct for differences in cause of death coding across time and locations, we modelled mortality due to dementia using prevalence data and estimates of excess mortality derived from countries that were most likely to code deaths to dementia relative to prevalence. Data were analysed by standardised methods to estimate deaths, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; computed as the sum of YLLs and YLDs), and the fractions of these metrics that were attributable to four risk factors that met GBD criteria for assessment (high body-mass index [BMI], high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages). Findings: In 2016, the global number of individuals who lived with dementia was 43{\textperiodcentered}8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 37{\textperiodcentered}8–51{\textperiodcentered}0), increased from 20.2 million (17{\textperiodcentered}4–23{\textperiodcentered}5) in 1990. This increase of 117% (95% UI 114–121) contrasted with a minor increase in age-standardised prevalence of 1{\textperiodcentered}7% (1{\textperiodcentered}0–2{\textperiodcentered}4), from 701 cases (95% UI 602–815) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 712 cases (614–828) per 100 000 population in 2016. More women than men had dementia in 2016 (27{\textperiodcentered}0 million, 95% UI 23{\textperiodcentered}3–31{\textperiodcentered}4, vs 16.8 million, 14.4–19.6), and dementia was the fifth leading cause of death globally, accounting for 2{\textperiodcentered}4 million (95% UI 2{\textperiodcentered}1–2{\textperiodcentered}8) deaths. Overall, 28{\textperiodcentered}8 million (95% UI 24{\textperiodcentered}5–34{\textperiodcentered}0) DALYs were attributed to dementia; 6{\textperiodcentered}4 million (95% UI 3{\textperiodcentered}4–10{\textperiodcentered}5) of these could be attributed to the modifiable GBD risk factors of high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. Interpretation: The global number of people living with dementia more than doubled from 1990 to 2016, mainly due to increases in population ageing and growth. Although differences in coding for causes of death and the heterogeneity in case-ascertainment methods constitute major challenges to the estimation of the burden of dementia, future analyses should improve on the methods for the correction of these biases. Until breakthroughs are made in prevention or curative treatment, dementia will constitute an increasing challenge to health-care systems worldwide. Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract  = {Dementia, a chronic and progressive cognitive declination of brain function caused by disease or impairment, is becoming more prevalent due to the aging population. A major challenge in dementia is achieving accurate and timely diagnosis. In recent years, neuroimaging with computer-aided algorithms have made remarkable advances in addressing this challenge. The success of these approaches is mostly attributed to the application of machine learning techniques for neuroimaging. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of automated diagnostic approaches for dementia using medical image analysis and machine learning algorithms published in the recent years. Based on the rigorous review of the existing works, we have found that, while most of the studies focused on Alzheimer's disease, recent research has demonstrated reasonable performance in the identification of other types of dementia remains a major challenge. Multimodal imaging analysis deep learning approaches have shown promising results in the diagnosis of these other types of dementia. The main contributions of this review paper are as follows. 1) Based on the detailed analysis of the existing literature, this paper discusses neuroimaging procedures for dementia diagnosis. 2) It systematically explains the most recent machine learning techniques and, in particular, deep learning approaches for early detection of dementia.},

  abstract  = {In a neuropsychological assessment, each test aims at measuring a single cognitive function. However, test performance depends on an interconnected system of cognitive functions and individual characteristics. For a better understanding of cognitive deficits, it is fundamental to recognize this complexity and study the relationships between test performances. This study aims to evaluate complexity in neuropsychological assessment through network analysis (NA) in 165 healthy older adults, 191 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 129 patients with vascular encephalopathy (VaE). NA is a flexible method to explore different domains where many variables are correlated with each other, and the relationships are key for understanding the domains. We included general aspects of individual differences (i.e., age, sex, years of education) and the raw scores of a clinically used neuropsychological battery in the network. Healthy subjects showed a segregated pattern, suggesting a good specificity of each test in measuring a specific cognitive function. Moreover, the scores were related to age and education. In the patient groups, the identified patterns changed in a consistent manner, showing less specificity and new relationships between the various tests, thereby reducing the impact of age and education on the performance. In particular, AD patients showed worse performance on the tests but also a different balance between different tasks, suggesting a reorganization of the cognitive system and not a mere decline. These results provide a new perspective in looking at the complexity of cognitive function assessment.},

There is an urgent need for methods that can overcome these challenges to model this complex data. At present there is no cure for dementia and no treatment that can successfully change the course of the disease. Machine learning models that can predict the time until a patient develops dementia are important tools in helping understand dementia risks and can give more accurate results than traditional statistical methods when modelling high-dimensional, heterogeneous, clinical data. This work compares the performance and stability of ten machine learning algorithms, combined with eight feature selection methods, capable of performing survival analysis of high-dimensional, heterogeneous, clinical data. We developed models that predict survival to dementia using baseline data from two different studies. The Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of 1037 participants, aged 70–90 years, that aims to determine the effects of ageing on cognition. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal study aimed at identifying biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease. Using the concordance index as a measure of performance, our models achieve maximum performance values of 0.82 for MAS and 0.93 For ADNI.},

Objective: To assess the ability of machine learning algorithms to predict dementia incidence within 2 years compared with existing models and determine the optimal analytic approach and number of variables required. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from a prospective cohort of 15307 participants without dementia at baseline to perform a secondary analysis of factors that could be used to predict dementia incidence. Participants attended National Alzheimer Coordinating Center memory clinics across the United States between 2005 and 2015. Analyses were conducted from March to May 2021. Exposures: 258 variables spanning domains of dementia-related clinical measures and risk factors. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was incident all-cause dementia diagnosed within 2 years of baseline assessment. Results: In a sample of 15307 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.3 [9.8] years; 9129 [60%] women and 6178 [40%] men) without dementia at baseline, 1568 (10%) received a diagnosis of dementia within 2 years of their initial assessment. Compared with 2 existing models for dementia risk prediction (ie, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia Risk Score, and the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator), machine learning algorithms were superior in predicting incident all-cause dementia within 2 years. The gradient-boosted trees algorithm had a mean (SD) overall accuracy of 92% (1%), sensitivity of 0.45 (0.05), specificity of 0.97 (0.01), and area under the curve of 0.92 (0.01) using all 258 variables. Analysis of variable importance showed that only 6 variables were required for machine learning algorithms to achieve an accuracy of 91% and area under the curve of at least 0.89. Machine learning algorithms also identified up to 84% of participants who received an initial dementia diagnosis that was subsequently reversed to mild cognitive impairment or cognitively unimpaired, suggesting possible misdiagnosis. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that machine learning algorithms could accurately predict incident dementia within 2 years in patients receiving care at memory clinics using only 6 variables. These findings could be used to inform the development and validation of decision-making aids in memory clinics..},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) has its onset many decades before dementia develops, and work is ongoing to characterise individuals at risk of decline on the basis of early detection through biomarker and cognitive testing as well as the presence/absence of identified risk factors. Risk prediction models for AD based on various computational approaches, including machine learning, are being developed with promising results. However, these approaches have been criticised as they are unable to generalise due to over-reliance on one data source, poor internal and external validations, and lack of understanding of prediction models, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these prediction models. We propose a framework that employs a transfer-learning paradigm with ensemble learning algorithms to develop explainable personalised risk prediction models for dementia. Our prediction models, known as source models, are initially trained and tested using a publicly available dataset (n = 84,856, mean age = 69 years) with 14 years of follow-up samples to predict the individual risk of developing dementia. The decision boundaries of the best source model are further updated by using an alternative dataset from a different and much younger population (n = 473, mean age = 52 years) to obtain an additional prediction model known as the target model. We further apply the SHapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm to visualise the risk factors responsible for the prediction at both population and individual levels. The best source model achieves a geometric accuracy of 87%, specificity of 99%, and sensitivity of 76%. In comparison to a baseline model, our target model achieves better performance across several performance metrics, within an increase in geometric accuracy of 16.9%, specificity of 2.7%, and sensitivity of 19.1%, an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 11% and a transfer learning efficacy rate of 20.6%. The strength of our approach is the large sample size used in training the source model, transferring and applying the “knowledge” to another dataset from a different and undiagnosed population for the early detection and prediction of dementia risk, and the ability to visualise the interaction of the risk factors that drive the prediction. This approach has direct clinical utility.},

We aimed to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies that applied machine learning (ML) methods to clinical data derived from electronic health records in order to model risk for progression of AD dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for articles published between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Explore Digital Library, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and arXiv. We used predefined criteria to select relevant articles and summarized them according to key components of ML analysis such as data characteristics, computational algorithms, and research focus. RESULTS: There has been a considerable rise over the past 5 years in the number of research papers using ML-based analysis for AD dementia modeling. We reviewed 64 relevant articles in our SLR. The results suggest that majority of existing research has focused on predicting progression of AD dementia using publicly available datasets containing both neuroimaging and clinical data (neurobehavioral status exam scores, patient demographics, neuroimaging data, and laboratory test values). DISCUSSION: Identifying individuals at risk for progression of AD dementia could potentially help to personalize disease management to plan future care. Clinical data consisting of both structured data tables and clinical notes can be effectively used in ML-based approaches to model risk for AD dementia progression. Data sharing and reproducibility of results can enhance the impact, adaptation, and generalizability of this research.},

  abstract = {Accurate computational models for clinical decision support systems require clean and reliable data but, in clinical practice, data are often incomplete. Hence, missing data could arise not only from training datasets but also test datasets which could consist of a single undiagnosed case, an individual. This work addresses the problem of extreme missingness in both training and test data by evaluating multiple imputation and classification workflows based on both diagnostic classification accuracy and computational cost. Extreme missingness is defined as having ∼50% of the total data missing in more than half the data features. In particular, we focus on dementia diagnosis due to long time delays, high variability, high attrition rates and lack of practical data imputation strategies in its diagnostic pathway. We identified and replicated the extreme missingness structure of data from a real-world memory clinic on a larger open dataset, with the original complete data acting as ground truth. Overall, we found that computational cost, but not accuracy, varies widely for various imputation and classification approaches. Particularly, we found that iterative imputation on the training dataset combined with a reduced-feature classification model provides the best approach, in terms of speed and accuracy. Taken together, this work has elucidated important factors to be considered when developing a predictive model for a dementia diagnostic support system.},

  abstract  = {Background: Item response theory (IRT) methods for addressing differential item functioning (DIF) can detect group differences in responses to individual items (e.g., bias). IRT and DIF-detection methods have been used increasingly often to identify bias in cognitive test performance by characteristics (DIF grouping variables) such as hearing impairment, race, and educational attainment. Previous analyses have not considered the effect of missing data on inferences, although levels of missing cognitive data can be substantial in epidemiologic studies. Methods: We used data from Visit 6 (2016–2017) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study (N = 3,580) to explicate the effect of artificially imposed missing data patterns and imputation on DIF detection. Results: When missing data was imposed among individuals in a specific DIF group but was unrelated to cognitive test performance, there was no systematic error. However, when missing data was related to cognitive test performance and DIF group membership, there was systematic error in DIF detection. Given this missing data pattern, the median DIF detection error associated with 10%, 30%, and 50% missingness was -0.03, -0.08, and -0.14 standard deviation (SD) units without imputation, but this decreased to -0.02, -0.04, and -0.08 SD units with multiple imputation. Conclusions: Incorrect inferences in DIF testing have downstream consequences for the use of cognitive tests in research. It is therefore crucial to consider the effect and reasons behind missing data when evaluating bias in cognitive testing.},

The complexity of the disease prevents the early diagnosis before visible symptoms regarding the individual's cognitive capabilities occur. This research presents an in-depth analysis of a huge data set encompassing medical, cognitive and lifestyle's measurements from more than 12,000 individuals. Several hypothesis were established whose validity has been questioned considering the obtained results. The importance of appropriate experimental design is highly stressed in the research. Thus, a sequence of methods for handling missing data, redundancy, data imbalance, and correlation analysis have been applied for appropriate preprocessing of the data set, and consequently XGBoost model has been trained and evaluated with special attention to the hyperparameters tuning. The model was explained by using the Shapley values produced by the SHAP method. XGBoost produced a f1-score of 0.84 and as such is considered to be highly competitive among those published in the literature. This achievement, however, was not the main contribution of this paper. This research's goal was to perform global and local interpretability of the intelligent model and derive valuable conclusions over the established hypothesis. Those methods led to a single scheme which presents either positive, or, negative influence of the values of each of the features whose importance has been confirmed by means of Shapley values. This scheme might be considered as additional source of knowledge for the physicians and other experts whose concern is the exact diagnosis of early stage of Alzheimer's disease. The conclusions derived from the intelligent model's data-driven interpretability confronted all the established hypotheses. This research clearly showed the importance of explainable Machine learning approach that opens the black box and clearly unveils the relationships among the features and the diagnoses.}

The initial objective of TADPOLE was the identification of the most predictive data, features, and methods for the progression of subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer0s. The challenge was successful in recognizing tree-based ensemble methods such as gradient boosting and random forest as the best methods for the prognosis of the clinical status in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the challenge outcome was limited to which combination of data processing and methods exhibits the best accuracy; hence, it is difficult to determine the contribution of the methods to the accuracy. The quantification of feature importance was globally approached by all the challenge participant methods. In addition, TADPOLE provided general answers that focused on improving performance while ignoring important issues such as interpretability. The purpose of this study is to intensively explore the models of the top three TADPOLE Challenge methods in a common framework for fair comparison. In addition, for these models, the most meaningful features for the prognosis of the clinical status of AD are studied and the contribution of each feature to the accuracy of the methods is quantified. We provide plausible explanations as to why the methods achieve such accuracy, and we investigate whether the methods use information coherent with clinical knowledge. Finally, we approach these issues through the analysis of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a technique that has recently attracted increasing attention in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).},

This paper proposes a novel approach by formulating clinical diagnosis as a reinforcement learning problem. During training, the reinforcement learning agent mimics the clinician{'}s cognitive process and learns the optimal policy to obtain the most appropriate diagnoses for a clinical narrative. This is achieved through an iterative search for candidate diagnoses from external knowledge sources via a sentence-by-sentence analysis of the inherent clinical context. A deep Q-network architecture is trained to optimize a reward function that measures the accuracy of the candidate diagnoses.

abstract = {Most machine learning researchers perform quantitative experiments to estimate generalization error and compare the performance of different algorithms (in particular, their proposed algorithm). In order to be able to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that don't take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied.},
