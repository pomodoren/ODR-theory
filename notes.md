### Getting things done

    Umberto Eco:
    - You are not Proust
    - You are not e.e.cummings.
    - Begin new paragraphs often.
    - Write everything that comes to your head.
    - Use the advisor as a guinea pig.
    - Do not insist on beginning with the first chapter.
    - Do not use ellipsis or exclamation points, and do not explain ironies.
    - Always define a term when you introduce it for the first time.
