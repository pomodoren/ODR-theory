# Chapter 6. Conclusions

The main objective of the work was to test whether there can be alternative ways to define the importance of the clinical criteria for Dementia using machine learning. Two main hypotheses were established based on the existing data and the practical necessity of the models. A pipeline was built allowing the extensive testing of several computational models, and the better pipeline was picked (LGBM) which combined minimal preprocessing and good sensitivity results. Then a further development of such work to include the descriptive statistics for each Dementia disease, and related single case analysis was presented. The comprehensive analysis suggests that  explainable machine learning models can be useful at providing complementary insights to the existing protocols.
