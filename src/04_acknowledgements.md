I thank my supervisors Gerardo Salvato and Gabriella Bottini, and my collaborators at Niguarda Hospital, Stefania Basilico and Maura Simioni. With their insights and their contribution, they made the thesis possible.
I thank my sisters, Klerisa and Gresa, for their unbent support of my interests and my direction. My parents, Shpresa and Agron, have trusted and contributed to my work with their folk knowledge of neuropsychology. This path would have been very lonely without you.
I am very grateful to the community working on Dementia, that has made the resources reachable, with an obsessive level of detail. To the open-source community of machine learning and the ones creating the tools that have been very useful to me since day one, thank you.
To `mor ve Ã¶tesi`, Sapolsky, and Jahangirov, thank you for inspiring me.
